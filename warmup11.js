// 3. Think about some different attributes of books â€“ what do all books have? Ideas include:

//  Title 
//  Author 
//  MSRP 
//  Genre 
//  Number of Pages 
//  Description
// . In terms of the properties of books that you thought of, represent the following books as data:
//  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (J.K. Rowling) 
//  Romeo and Juliet (William Shakespeare) 
//  Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Gerald Jay Sussman, Hal Abelson) 
//  NOTE: Did you account for the possibility of two authors? If not, update your model to handle multiple authors. 
//  Three other books (see this list for ideas)
// You may have been rewriting the same type of object over and over. We need to stay DRY (Do Not Repeat). 
// Write a function makeBook that takes as arguments different attributes of a book and returns an object representing that book that has the proper structure (we call this a factory function).

//  Look at one of your book objects in the console. This is the object inspector. The object inspector is nice to have, but it will be easier to have a function to display the more important information easily. Write a function called displayBook that takes a book as an argument, and returns the important information in a more readable way,

// for example:

// var sorcerersStone = { /* ... */ } 
//  function displayBook(book) { 
//        // ... 
//  } 
//  displayBook(sorcerersStone); 
//  // => 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling -- fantasy, $24.99'
