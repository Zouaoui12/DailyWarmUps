 // Write a JavaScript function that will iterate from n to 0. For each iteration,
 // it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.
 // iterateAndLog(3); =>
 // Sample Output :
 // "2 is even"
 // "1 is odd"
 // "0 is even"

 // RECURSIVELY
 // Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers
 // That is, fib(0) is 1, fib(1) is 1, fib(2) is 2, fib(3) is 3, fib(4) is 5, etc.
 //  Notice that each fibonacci number can be computed by adding the previous two fibonacci numbers,
 //  with the exception of the first two: fib(0) and fib(1). More succinctly,
 //  fib(0) is 1
 //  fib(1) is 1
 //  fib(n) is fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
 //  Write a function called fib that accepts a number n as a parameter and computes the nth fibonacci number using the above rules.
 

function fib(number) {

// The Reading List 
// An object-oriented book-list!

// Create a class BookList

// Create another class called Book

// BookLists should have the following properties:

// Number of books marked as read
// Number of books marked not read yet
// A reference to the next book to read (book object)
// A reference to the current book being read (book object)
// A reference to the last book read (book object)
// An array of all the Books
// Each Book should have several properties:

// Title
// Genre
// Author
// Read (true or false)
// Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() objectLinks to an external site.
// Every Booklist should have a few methods:

// .add(book)
// should add a book to the books list.
// .finishCurrentBook()
// should mark the book that is currently being read as "read"
// Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
// Change the last book read to be the book that just got finished
// Change the current book to be the next book to be read
// Change the next book to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books
// Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.
