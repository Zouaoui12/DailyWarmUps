// The Reading List 
// An object-oriented book-list!

// Create a class BookList

// Create another class called Book

// BookLists should have the following properties:

// Number of books marked as read
// Number of books marked not read yet
// A reference to the next book to read (book object)
// A reference to the current book being read (book object)
// A reference to the last book read (book object)
// An array of all the Books
// Each Book should have several properties:

// Title
// Genre
// Author
// Read (true or false)
// Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() objectLinks to an external site.
// Every Booklist should have a few methods:

// .add(book)
// should add a book to the books list.
// .finishCurrentBook()
// should mark the book that is currently being read as "read"
// Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
// Change the last book read to be the book that just got finished
// Change the current book to be the next book to be read
// Change the next book to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books
// Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.
